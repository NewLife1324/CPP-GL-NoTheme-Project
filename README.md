# CPP GL NoTheme Project
 The very first language I learned after pascal was C++. I never really learned it, but I had a lot of experience and problems with it. Python is naturally simpler, but it's still not perfect. It automates and simplifies a lot, has a huge community, but still not so good, besides, this language is interoperable. I'm going back to C++ for a while, maybe I'll re-invent the scariest things I've done in python? The project still does not have a theme and purpose. Good luck to me in programming, and to you in trying to understand me. Thanks for your attention
